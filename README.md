# FS19 AutoDrive Sort

I'm playing FS19 with a PS4 Controller, and like to cycle thru the destinations using the controller, 
but AutoDrive (now v1.1.0.5-RC5) cylces thru the destination by adding date, not alphabetically.

So I created a small console app (C#) that does the sort for me.

## Usage

Copy the .exe into your savegame directory. Run it, it will look for the xml file of AutoDrive, and sorts the destinations.

It also copies the old xml file as a backup. If you want to test it, you can also copy the autodrive xml file in another directory with the exe and try it there.

And... you'll need to save your game and close your game to make it work (no need to fully quit FS19).
